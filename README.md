# EchoLink

A simple messenger web application.

EchoLink lets users join or create chat rooms using unique codes. It can connect over the internet using lightweight tools like Ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel, and more.

🛠️ How it works:
Enter your name and a room code — or generate your own — and start chatting instantly.

🔒 Security Notice:
There is no security measures for now cuz this is just a silly project. However security IS planned in the upcomming future

🎨 UI Credit:
CSS and styling were fully generated by ChatGPT, because I have zero clue about design and even less taste.
